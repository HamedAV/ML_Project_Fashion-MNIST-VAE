# ML_Project_Fashion-MNIST-VAE
This is the final project for the Machine Learning course presented by Ali Sharifi Zarchi at Sharif University of Technology.  
In this project, the goal is to build a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for image generation and improve it so that:

It generates higher-quality samples,

The latent space exhibits more interpretable structure, and

The generation process can be controlled using class labels (conditional generation).
